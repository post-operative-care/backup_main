Postoperative Care for spine sugery. 
1. Keep the incision dry for the first 5 to 7 days.
2. The first time you shower, have someone help you.
3. Cover the incision with plastic wrap.
4. Do NOT bend, twist, lift heavy objects and drive.
5. DO NOT allow water from the shower head to spray the incision.
6. DO NOT smoke or use tobacco products after spine surgery. Avoiding tobacco is even more important if you had a fusion or graft. Smoking and using tobacco products slows the healing process.
